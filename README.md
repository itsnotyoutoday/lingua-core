# pod-loader-rpc

Build a job, push it onto rented compute, watch it run, and be certain it dies when it
should.

The client side of [`pod-harness`](https://github.com/itsnotyoutoday/pod-harness). It shares
no code with it — the two agree on a versioned contract and talk over HTTP.

---

## 1. What this is for

You have work that needs a bigger machine than your laptop for an hour or two. Renting one
is easy; doing it *safely and repeatably* is three separate problems:

1. **Getting the job there.** Your code, your spec and your data have to reach a machine
   that did not exist a minute ago — without putting credentials or a git token on it.
2. **Knowing what happened.** The provider offers no logs API. A pod is either watched live
   or it is a black box, and "the script exited 0" is not the same as "it produced
   something".
3. **Making sure it stops.** This is the one that costs money. An in-pod timeout **cannot
   terminate a RunPod pod** — `runpodctl` from inside returns `Unauthorized`. It detects
   the overrun, tries to self-delete, is refused, logs the refusal, and keeps billing.

This handles all three: it publishes your code and spec to object storage, provisions a pod
pointed at them, drives it over `/v1`, and guarantees termination from outside the pod,
where termination actually works.

**Three rules it enforces, because each one has already gone wrong**

- **The pod holds no credentials.** Code arrives as objects the pod can already read. No
  git access, no API key, nothing to leak.
- **The loader assigns; workers never discover.** A worker that scans a queue can race
  another worker, and object storage cannot arbitrate. Every pod is told what it owns.
- **This package is never installed in a pod.** It can provision compute; a pod must not
  be able to. `pod-harness` fails its own build if any of these modules appear inside it.

---

## 2. Building a job

A job is a **workload repo** with two things in it: stage code, and a spec naming which
stages to run.

### Directory layout

```
my-workload/
  code/
    mywork/
      __init__.py
      stages.py         the stage registry — the only required file
  jobs/
    my-job.json         one spec per job you want to run
  .pod.env              how it launches (§3b)
```

`code/` is the convention that matters: **only that directory is published**, and it
becomes an import root on the pod. So `code/mywork/stages.py` is importable as
`mywork.stages`.

### The stage registry

```python
# code/mywork/stages.py
from pod_harness.framework import Stage, Verification   # convenience; duck typing works too

class ExtractStage(Stage):
    name, number = "extract", 1
    produces = ("rows",)

    def execute(self, ctx):
        rows = read(ctx.params["input"])
        for i, r in enumerate(rows):
            ctx.progress(i, len(rows))      # sub-stage progress, throttled to ~1/sec
        ctx.put("rows", rows)
        return {"count": len(rows)}

    def verify_outputs(self, ctx):          # optional, strongly encouraged
        rows = ctx.get("rows")
        return Verification(ok=bool(rows), checks={"rows": len(rows or [])})

STAGES = {"extract": ExtractStage, "transform": TransformStage}
```

`verify_outputs` is what makes the framework worth using. Without it, a stage that reports
success while producing nothing is indistinguishable from one that worked — a bug that
occurred three times in the project this grew out of, once as a glob matching `*.wav`
against a FLAC corpus and cheerfully reporting "40 files" that were zero files.

> **Do not vendor `pod-harness` into `code/`** (no git submodules). The code root is
> prepended to `PYTHONPATH` on the pod, so a vendored copy would shadow the image's and you
> would have two harnesses resolved by import order. Depend on it for *development* only —
> the image supplies it at runtime:
> ```toml
> dev = ["pod-harness @ git+https://github.com/itsnotyoutoday/pod-harness.git@<sha>"]
> ```

## 3. How to run

### a) The job spec

`jobs/my-job.json` says which stages to run and hands the workload its parameters.

```json
{
  "spec_version": 2,
  "pipeline": {
    "stages_from": "mywork.stages:STAGES",
    "stages": ["extract", "transform"]
  },
  "mount":  {"kind": "volume"},
  "resume": {"enabled": true, "from": "auto"},
  "params": {"input": "data/batch-7", "workers": 8}
}
```

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `stages_from` | `module:attribute` — where your registry lives |
| `stages` | which to run, in order. A name not in the registry is rejected before launch |
| `resume.from` | `auto` re-runs `verify_outputs()` per completed stage and restarts at the first that fails. Never marker-driven: a `.DONE` file once survived a wiped volume and reported "done: 24" over no outputs |
| `params` | yours. Opaque to the framework |

Check it without spending anything:

```bash
python -m pod_loader.contract jobs/my-job.json
```

### b) The launch file

`.pod.env` sits in the directory you launch from, found by walking upward to `$HOME`. A
launch has a dozen inputs; passing them as flags means retyping them, and retyping means
getting one wrong on the attempt that matters.

```bash
python -m pod_loader.launchfile --template > .pod.env
python -m pod_loader.launchfile              # show what resolved, and check it
```

```bash
# ---- destination -------------------------------------------------------------
TARGET            = runpod                 # runpod | docker | local
IMAGE             = ghcr.io/itsnotyoutoday/pod-harness:latest

# ---- capacity, in priority order ---------------------------------------------
COMPUTE           = CPU
CPU_FLAVORS       = cpu3c,cpu3g,cpu5c,cpu5g,cpu3m,cpu5m
GPU_TYPES         = NVIDIA RTX A4000,NVIDIA RTX A4500,NVIDIA RTX A5000
CLOUD             = SECURE,COMMUNITY
FALLBACK_TO_GPU   = false
MAX_COST_HR       = 0.20

# ---- cost --------------------------------------------------------------------
BUDGET_MIN        = 60                     # hard kill, enforced outside the pod
QUEUE_DEADLINE_MIN= 240

# ---- storage -----------------------------------------------------------------
STORE             = runpod                 # a PROFILE, never a credential
RUNPOD_VOLUME     = ~/runpod-volume.key    # RunPod only; PINS the datacentre
CACHE             = persistent             # persistent | ephemeral | off

# ---- the job -----------------------------------------------------------------
JOB_SPEC          = jobs/my-job.json
WORKLOAD          = .
AUTORUN           = true

# ---- forwarded to the pod with ENV_ stripped ---------------------------------
# ENV_MY_SETTING  = value
```

**Never put a secret in it.** `STORE` names a profile; credentials live in `*.key` files
outside the repo. The loader *refuses* a value under a key ending
`SECRET`/`PASSWORD`/`API_KEY`/`ACCESS_KEY`/`TOKEN` that is not a path to a real file —
because this file sits beside the job, which means it gets committed.

One-time credential setup:

```bash
cat > ~/runpod.key        <<< 'api_key = <your runpod key>'
cat > ~/runpod-volume.key <<< 'volume_id = <your network volume id>'
```

### c) Launch

```bash
cd my-workload
python runctl.py launch --dry-run     # validate everything, provision nothing
python runctl.py launch               # for real
```

`--dry-run` is free and does everything short of spending money: reads `.pod.env`,
publishes the code, validates the spec against the harness contract, resolves the volume,
and reports how many placements it would try. Run it first.

```
launch config: /path/my-workload/.pod.env
code: 4 files → code/my-workload/93303c4
spec: runs/job1786655065/spec.json
volume: ya09dvvcwq in US-NC-1 (pins compute to that datacenter)
✓ pod abc123  job=job1786655065
```

Code publishes to `code/<workload>/<git-sha>/` — or `dev` if your tree is dirty. That
distinction matters: publishing to a mutable path can change code under a **running** job,
and Python's lazy imports would then mix two versions inside one process.

### d) Check on it

```bash
python runctl.py watch --job <job_id>      # status + live log
python runctl.py poll  --job <job_id>      # progress only
python runctl.py fetch --job <job_id>      # pull artifacts back
python runctl.py kill                      # terminate now
```

Or over HTTP — what a web app or an agent would use:

```bash
curl -H "X-Podh-Token: $TOKEN" https://<pod>-8000.proxy.runpod.net/v1/jobs/$JOB/summary
curl -H "X-Podh-Token: $TOKEN" https://<pod>-8000.proxy.runpod.net/v1/jobs/$JOB/stages
```

`/summary` is a ~500-token digest — start there. `/stages` gives per-stage verification
detail. The status key is **`job_state`**, not `state`.

Status is mirrored to object storage as it goes, so it survives the pod. Afterwards, read
`runs/<job_id>/status.json` from the bucket.

---

## 4. Advanced

### All `runctl` commands

```bash
python runctl.py create   --provider runpod   # bare runner, no job
python runctl.py status                       # one runner, or all
python runctl.py mount                        # attach storage
python runctl.py push                         # upload data where a runner can reach it
python runctl.py ls | cat | browse            # inspect the object store; browse opens a UI
python runctl.py submit  --spec …             # send a job to a runner already up
python runctl.py shutdown | destroy           # stop vs terminate — stopping still bills
```

### Guaranteed termination

```python
from pod_loader import reaper

with reaper.pod(create_kwargs, budget_min=60) as pod:
    ...
```

| layer | covers |
|---|---|
| context manager | normal exit, exceptions, Ctrl-C, SIGTERM |
| deadline thread | wall clock exceeded while the main thread is blocked on a hung call |
| `reaper.sweep()` | pods orphaned by a process that died before its `finally` could run |

Every launch is journaled to disk **before** the API call returns, so a pod whose creating
process vanished is still discoverable. A pod nobody journaled is a pod nobody can find.

> **Known gap.** All three layers need a process alive on your machine. If your laptop
> sleeps with a pod up, nothing reaps it. A long-lived reaper service is the fix and is not
> built yet.

### Capacity is a priority list, not a value

RunPod takes the first shape with capacity, so an ordered list degrades instead of failing.
The walk covers **three** dimensions:

```
flavor   cpu3c → cpu3g → cpu5c → cpu5g → cpu3m → cpu5m
cloud    SECURE → COMMUNITY
type     CPU → GPU                    ← opt-in, ~12× the price
```

A list within one compute type is not enough: on 2026-08-13 all six CPU flavours were
exhausted on **both** clouds while GPU had capacity — and a network volume pins you to one
datacentre, so there is no other region to fall back to.

That is why `FALLBACK_TO_GPU` requires `MAX_COST_HR`: $0.06/hr → $0.74/hr. A four-minute
benchmark does not care; a six-hour build is $0.36 against $4.44. Cost and capacity resolve
into **one** decision — if the only free slot is too expensive, that is a reason to wait,
not a placement. An over-budget pod that does get created is terminated immediately,
because it bills from the instant it exists.

### Storage profiles

```bash
python -m pod_loader.volume                    # resolve and describe the RunPod volume
python -m pod_loader.sync ../workload --dry-run
```

| profile | true S3? | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `runpod` | **no** | no presigned URLs, `delete_objects` returns 307, `head_object` 403s on large objects |
| `cloudflare` | yes | verified including presigned URLs; signing region must be `auto` |
| `aws`, `minio` | yes | |

RunPod's endpoint is `RUNPOD_STORE_*` rather than `*_S3_*` deliberately. Calling it S3
invited code to assume S3 semantics, and all three limitations above were found the
expensive way. Ask instead of assuming:

```python
from pod_loader.capabilities import flavor_for
flavor_for(endpoint).require("presigned", "batch_delete")   # raises at plan time
```

A named profile that cannot be resolved **raises** rather than falling back to the default
store. It used to fall back, so `get_storage("cloudflare")` silently returned the RunPod
store — writes intended for one bucket landing in another, and looking successful.

### Using it as a library

```python
from pod_loader import contract, launchfile, reaper, sync, volume

cfg  = launchfile.load()
root = sync.publish(cfg.workload)["root"]
env  = launchfile.pod_env(cfg, job_id=jid, spec_key=key, code_root=root)

assert not contract.check_env(env)                              # required vars present
contract.require_valid(spec, contract.from_image(pod_url))      # against the live image

with reaper.pod(create, budget_min=cfg.budget_min,
                capacity=launchfile.capacity_kwargs(cfg)) as pod:
    ...
```

Read the required env set from the contract rather than hardcoding it: when the harness
starts needing a new root, launches fail while composing instead of the pod refusing to
boot.

### Adding a provider

`provider.py` defines the interface; `RunPodProvider` and `LocalProvider` implement it.
Adding a backend is a class, not a rewrite — everything above it speaks the same `/v1`.

### Storage layout

`paths.py` and `store.py` own the object-key layout, and the harness deliberately does not.
That knowledge used to live in both and the copies drifted three times in one day. One
definition here; the harness is told, and is granted only the prefixes it may write to.
