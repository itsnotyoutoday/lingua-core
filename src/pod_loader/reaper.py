"""Guaranteed pod termination — the external janitor, now known to be mandatory.

## Why this is not optional

Verified on a real pod (2026-08-13): `runpodctl` invoked from INSIDE a RunPod pod returns
`Error: Unauthorized`. There is no pod-scoped credential. This settles the contradiction
between plexus's `trainer.Dockerfile` (which claimed self-delete works) and its
`runpod_cleanup.py` (which said it does not) — the latter was right.

The consequence is sharper than it first looks: `lingua-watchdog`'s MAX_LIFE_SEC ceiling
CANNOT terminate a RunPod pod. It will faithfully detect the timeout, call self-delete, be
refused, and log that it was refused — while the pod keeps billing. An in-pod ceiling is a
detection mechanism, not a cost control. Treating it as one is how a pod runs overnight.

So termination must come from outside, and it must not depend on a human noticing.

## Three layers, each covering the previous one's failure

    with pod(...) as p:      terminates on success, exception, KeyboardInterrupt, SIGTERM
    deadline thread          terminates when wall-clock exceeds the budget, even if the
                             main thread is blocked on a hung HTTP call
    sweep()                  terminates anything left behind by a process that died before
                             its finally block could run — the case the first two cannot
                             cover, because a killed process runs no cleanup

Every launch is journaled to disk BEFORE the API call returns, so a pod that exists but
whose creating process vanished is still discoverable. A pod that is never journaled is a
pod nobody can find.
