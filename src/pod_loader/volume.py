"""RunPod network volumes — deliberately named for the one provider that has them.

## Why this is not called LINGUA_VOLUME

Every other storage concept in this codebase is portable: an S3-compatible store is an
S3-compatible store whether it is R2, MinIO or AWS, so it gets a neutral name and a
neutral interface. A RunPod network volume is not that. Nothing else offers it, it cannot
be emulated, and attaching one PINS compute to the volume's datacenter — which is the
failure that blocked every job the day US-NC-1 filled up.

Naming it `LINGUA_VOLUME_ID` would have implied a portable concept and quietly invited
generic code to depend on it. So the environment variable carries the provider in its
name:

    RUNPOD_VOLUME=/path/to/runpod-volume.key

A reader who sees `RUNPOD_VOLUME` in a launcher knows immediately that this launch is
RunPod-only. That is the whole point of the name.

The same reasoning corrects an earlier mistake. RunPod's object endpoint was configured
through `LINGUA_S3_*` as though it were S3, and it is not: no presigned URLs, no batch
delete, `head_object` returns 403 on large objects. Calling it S3 made code assume
capabilities it does not have. Real S3-compatible stores (R2, AWS, MinIO) keep the neutral
name; RunPod's partial implementation is flagged for what it is.

## Why the file holds an id and not a description

The file needs only:

    volume_id = <volume-id>

Everything else — datacenter, size, name, current usage — is asked of RunPod, because
RunPod is the authority on its own volume. A file that also recorded `datacenter = US-NC-1`
would be a second source of truth, and the copy that goes stale is always the one you
read. Optional overrides are accepted for offline use, but the API wins when reachable.

## Why a file rather than a plain id in the environment

Consistency with every other credential in this system: `s3-cloudfare.key`, `runpod.key`.
They are gitignored by pattern (`*.key`), so a volume reference cannot be committed by
someone following the obvious path. An inline `RUNPOD_VOLUME=<volume-id>` is also accepted,
because refusing it would only push people toward hardcoding — but the file is the
documented form.
