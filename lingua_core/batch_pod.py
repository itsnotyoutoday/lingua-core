"""Batch pods — provision, run one instruction file, exit.

## How the pod is told what to do

Through the network volume, which is the same storage as the S3 bucket:

    laptop                     volume / bucket                pod
    ------                     ---------------                ---
    runctl launch  ──put──▶    jobs/<id>.json      ──▶  /workspace/jobs/<id>.json
                               corpus/raw/...      ──▶  /workspace/corpus/raw/...
                   ◀──get──    logs/<id>.log       ◀──  /workspace/logs/<id>.log
                   ◀──get──    out/regions/...     ◀──  /workspace/out/regions/...

So changing an instruction is a 2 KB upload, not a 2 GB image rebuild. The image holds
CODE; the volume holds DATA and INSTRUCTIONS. Nothing job-specific is ever baked in.

## Why there is no web API

A server would need a port, auth, and something to babysit it — for a process that runs once
and exits. The volume already gives a bidirectional channel that survives the pod dying, and
a spot instance can vanish mid-run without losing a byte. An API earns its place for
on-demand work (RunPod Serverless), not for batch.

## Why the pod must not exit instantly

A pod is only "up" while its process runs. An image whose CMD returns immediately leaves a
pod that bills, reports no runtime and opens no port — it looks broken in the console. The
start command here does the work in the foreground, so the pod lives exactly as long as the
job and stops billing when it finishes.
